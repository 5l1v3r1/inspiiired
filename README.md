This repo is all about giving inspiration & ideas for your next project.

Picking the right color combination can be hard sometimes.<br>
By trying different combinations have helped me pick the right one countless times.<br>
Manually doing it can be painful. That's why I created Inspiiired.

Inspiiired picks two random colors and adds a linear-gradient between them.<br>
To generate a new color, you just to hit space.<br>
The rest is done for you.

If you think you've found the right combination, all you have to do is<br>
click on the color code and then click the copy button. That's it.
