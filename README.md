# INSPIIIRED

This repo is all about giving inspiration & ideas for your next project.

Sometimes picking the right color combination might be hard. By trying different<br>
combinations have helped me pick the right one. Manually doing it<br>
can be painful. That's why I created Inspiiired.

Inspiiired picks two colors and adds a linear gradient between them.<br>
The color is completely random, aswell as the angle of the gradient.<br>

To generate a new color, you just to hit space.<br>
The rest is done for you.

If you think you've found the right combination, all you have to do is<br>
click on the color code and then click the copy button. That's it!
